A PowerShell application that bypasses the native Windows wallpaper settings to apply wallpapers directly with advanced scaling and styling options. Works without administrator privileges.

## Features

- [x] **Dual Method Support**: Choose between native Windows API or registry manipulation methods
- [x] **GUI Mode**: Interactive graphical interface for easy wallpaper selection
- [x] **CLI Mode**: Command-line interface for automation and scripting
- [x] **Image Validation**: Automatic validation to detect corrupted or invalid image files
- [x] **Display Modes**: Choose between Tile (repeat) or Fullscreen display
- [x] **Stretch Options**: In fullscreen mode, choose between centered or stretched display
- [x] **Multi-Monitor Support**: Apply wallpapers to specific monitors or span a single image across all screens
- [x] **Image Preview**: Live preview of selected images before applying
- [x] **No Admin Required**: Works without administrator privileges using registry-based methods

## Supported Image Formats

- JPG / JPEG
- PNG
- BMP
- GIF
- TIFF / TIF

## Requirements

- Windows 7 or later
- PowerShell 3.0 or later
- No special privileges required

## Usage

### GUI Mode (Interactive)

Simply run the launcher batch file:

```cmd
launcher.bat
```

Or run the PowerShell script directly:

```powershell
.\wallpaper_setter.ps1
```

This opens a window where you can:

1. Click **`Browse...`** to select an image file
2. View the image preview on the right side
3. Select the target monitor:
   - **Current**: The monitor where the application window is located
   - **Primary**: The main system monitor
   - **DISPLAY#**: Specific monitor by its hardware name
   - **All**: Apply the same image to all monitors
   - **Spanned**: Span a single image across all connected monitors
4. Select the display mode:
   - **Tile (repeat)**: Repeats the image across the entire screen
   - **Full screen**: Displays the image in full screen
5. In fullscreen mode, check optional options:
   - **Stretch to fill**: Stretches the image to fill the entire screen (otherwise it will be fitted while keeping aspect ratio)
6. Check other options:
   - **Use Registry method**: Use registry manipulation instead of native Windows API (try this if the default method fails)
7. Click **`Apply`** to set the wallpaper
8. Click **`Exit`** to close without applying changes

### CLI Mode (Command Line)

Use the following syntax for command-line usage:

```powershell
.\wallpaper_setter.ps1 -Path "C:\path\to\image.jpg" [Options]
```

#### Options:
- `-Path <path>` (required): Full path to the image file
- `-DisplayMode <mode>`: Display mode: 'tile' (repeat) or 'fullscreen' (default)
- `-Monitor <monitor>`: Target monitor: 'primary', 'all', or hardware index (e.g., '0', '1'). Defaults to 'primary'.
- `-Stretch`: Stretch image to fill screen (fullscreen mode only)
- `-Spanned`: Apply as single spanned wallpaper across all monitors
- `-UseRegistryMethod`: Use registry manipulation method instead of native API
- `-Help`: Display help message

<br>
Note: The Registry method (which disables the monitor selection option) applies the wallpaper globally to all screens using legacy Windows scaling routines.

#### Examples:

Apply on primary monitor:
```powershell
.\wallpaper_setter.ps1 -Path "C:\path\to\image.jpg"
```

Apply on a specific monitor (e.g., monitor 1):
```powershell
.\wallpaper_setter.ps1 -Path "C:\path\to\image.jpg" -Monitor 1
```

Apply as single spanned image across all monitors:
```powershell
.\wallpaper_setter.ps1 -Path "C:\path\to\image.jpg" -Spanned
```

Apply an image in fullscreen centered mode:
```powershell
.\wallpaper_setter.ps1 -Path "C:\Users\MyUser\Pictures\image.jpg" -DisplayMode fullscreen
```

Apply an image in fullscreen stretched mode:
```powershell
.\wallpaper_setter.ps1 -Path "C:\Users\MyUser\Pictures\image.jpg" -DisplayMode fullscreen -Stretch
```

Apply an image in tile mode (repeat):
```powershell
.\wallpaper_setter.ps1 -Path "C:\Users\MyUser\Pictures\image.jpg" -DisplayMode tile
```

Apply an image using the registry method:
```powershell
.\wallpaper_setter.ps1 -Path "C:\Users\MyUser\Pictures\image.jpg" -UseRegistryMethod
```

View help:
```powershell
.\wallpaper_setter.ps1 -Help
```

## How It Works

WSB bypasses the standard Windows Settings GUI by directly modifying wallpaper configuration:

1. **GUI Mode**: Launches an interactive window using Windows Forms to select and configure wallpaper settings
2. **Display Modes**:
   - **Tile**: Repeats the image across the entire screen (WallpaperStyle=1, TileWallpaper=1)
   - **Fullscreen Fitted**: Displays the image fitted to screen while keeping aspect ratio (WallpaperStyle=6, TileWallpaper=0)
   - **Fullscreen Stretched**: Displays the image stretched to fill the screen (WallpaperStyle=2, TileWallpaper=0)
3. **Dual Method Approach**:
   - **Default Method**: Uses the `IDesktopWallpaper` COM interface for per-monitor wallpaper, with fallback to `SystemParametersInfo` on failure
   - **Registry Method**: Directly manipulates Windows registry settings:
     - `Wallpaper`: Path to the wallpaper image
     - `WallpaperStyle`: 1 for tile, 2 for stretch, 6 for fitted
     - `TileWallpaper`: 1 for tiling, 0 for no tiling
4. **Fallback Strategy**: If the default method fails in GUI mode, automatically offers to try the registry method
5. **Desktop Refresh**: Triggers immediate wallpaper display without requiring system restart

## Troubleshooting

### PowerShell execution policy error?

If you see "File cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled", use the launcher batch file instead:

```cmd
launcher.bat
```

This bypasses execution policy restrictions. Alternatively, enable script execution:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Image not applying?

- Check that the image file path is correct
- Verify the image file is in a supported format and not corrupted
- Try using the `-UseRegistryMethod` flag if the default method doesn't work
- Ensure the Windows Registry is accessible (not restricted by group policies)

### Registry method is slow or not working?

The registry method may take a moment to refresh the wallpaper. If it doesn't apply immediately:

- Wait a few seconds and the wallpaper should update
- Try applying again, sometimes the registry method requires multiple attempts to take effect
- Use the launcher batch file if execution policy is preventing the PowerShell script from running

### Preview not loading?

The preview may fail to load for unsupported formats. You can still apply the wallpaper using the image file path.

## Notes

- The application stores the wallpaper path in your user registry
- Network paths (UNC paths) are supported for image files
- Image files are validated before processing to detect corruption
